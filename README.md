# 🍕 Pizza Sales Dashboard (Power BI + PostgreSQL)

📌 Project Overview
This is my first ever dashboard project, built using Power BI and connected to a PostgreSQL database. It’s a simple start, but a meaningful milestone in my data journey. The goal was to explore pizza sales data and turn it into a clear, interactive dashboard that tells a business story.

🧭 Dashboard Structure
Page 1: Business KPIs + Trends
- Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Total Pizza Sold, Total Orders, Avg Pizza per Order
- Daily and Monthly Order Trends
- % of Sales by Category and Size
- Total Sales by Category

Page 2: Best/Worst Sellers
- Ranked by Total Revenue, Total Orders, and Total Quantity

🛠️ Tools Used
- PostgreSQL: as the data source
- Power BI: for dashboard design, DAX logic, and page navigation
- DAX: for time intelligence and dynamic filtering

🐍 What’s Next: 
I’ve started learning Python for automation and data workflows, and I’m excited to integrate it into future projects alongside SQL and Power BI.
